This is a simple example to show the difference between three important keywords in PHP OOP i.e. self, static, $this.

### Result ###
* Keywords $this and static always refers to the child class regardless of execution place.
It means whether the keywords $this and static are used in child or parent class they refer to child class.
* On the other hand self refers to the class in which it is used.
* So if self is used in child class then it will run method show in child class and if it runs in parent then parent class
method show will be executed.
